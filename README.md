Designed using Python and the OpenCV library, this project aims to enhance road safety through artificial intelligence technologies.

The system continuously monitors the driver's condition and provides alerts in two primary scenarios:

Drowsiness: If the system detects signs that the driver is feeling sleepy or losing focus.
Phone Usage: If the system observes that the driver is using their mobile phone while driving.

To make the alerts more effective, the AI system emits audible warnings personalized with the driver's name, such as "Wake up, Ahmed, you're sleepy" or "Put down the phone, Ahmed, you're sleepy." This feature ensures that the alerts are more engaging and impactful for the driver.

By providing immediate and personalized alerts, this technology helps ensure the safety of everyone on the road by preventing accidents caused by unsafe driving behaviors.
